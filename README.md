Hi.  I made the necessary changes to complete all of the work specified in the project.  
For the vector, I simply used the half way vector.
Creating the Phong shading was very easy and all it required was some minor changes in the file to turn it from gourard to Phong.

For the artsy shading, I was proud to be able to complete this assignment without any office hour help, and after a few trial and errors I realized that the
texture file that was being put in was simply the standard one.  I switched it to the artsy textures for diffuse and specular, and
I was able to use the right equations to create the proper shading.

Lastly, for the outline, making it black was easy as all I had to see was if the two vectors were pointing in opposite-ish directions and then applying 
a thickness as necessary.  Project was completed on time with no complications.

Thanks!
